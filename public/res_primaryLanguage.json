      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Xin. I graduated college with an environmental science degree and realized too late that I didnâ€™t like spending the majority of my time writing research papers and because I needed time to rethink my career, the first job I took out of college was working as a receptionist at a vet clinic. Where I realized I actually had a knack for team leadership and problem solving when I moved to a lead position and the first thing I did was create a training guide for new hires because I wanted to set others up for success in a less stressful way that I experienced. But, I needed a more fulfilling career and so I went to a coding school where I saw how creative tech can be. Itâ€™s a great balance of art and stem which I love so Iâ€™m ready to channel that passion into any project",
