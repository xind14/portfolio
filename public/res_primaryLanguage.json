      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Xin, and I'm starting an exciting journey from veterinary clinic team management to the forward-thinking world of software development. While working as a lead receptionist, I honed my multitasking and problem-solving skills. But, I felt stagnant and knew I needed a change to pursue a more fulfilling and stable career path that involved a lot more creativity and impact. I entered this field because it merges creativity with the potentials of technology. But what really motivates me is the opportunity to design user-friendly applications and be a part of pioneering innovations. I excel in environments where collaboration is central, and where progressive ideas come to life. My advantage lies in my background in client-facing roles, where I've come to understand the importance of seamless user interactions. I'm excited to apply this expertise in the tech industry. With strong problem-solving skills and effective communication abilities, I'm looking forward to making a valuable contribution to any software development team.",
